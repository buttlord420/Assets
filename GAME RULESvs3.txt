TURN PROGRESSION:

//selection phase
-> highlight all selectable gunners
-> start round timer
WHEN player selects a gunner,
	-> de-highlight all other gunners
	-> generate movement map (normal movement and dash movement zones)
	-> make SHOOT, SHIELD, and OVERWATCH abilities selectable
//movement phase
WHEN player moves,
-> begin movement procedures
	-> WHEN exiting a pixel
		-> movement points -1
		-> record orientation 
	-> WHEN entering a pixel
		-> 'moving shield' (matterson conglomerate) generated
		-> 'overwatch' (xin security detail) enacted
	-> REPEAT process until gunner reaches destination
	-> end movement procedures
-> IF player DASHED, end turn
//a player DASHES if they move outside of the blue-outlined circle and into the larger, concentric yellow-outline dash circle
IF player has remaining movement points,
-> generate movement map
//dash is no longer available
-> repeat movement procedures until movement points are expended/player clicks on "end movement phase"
//abilities phase
-> highlight SHOOT and SHIELD abilities
IF player clicks on SHOOT,
-> run shoot procedures
	-> let player cycle targets
		-> highlighted if available
		-> lowlighted if shielded
	-> when player inputs confirmation, fire bullet, compute hit/block
	-> end turn
IF player clicks on SHIELD
-> run shield procedure
	-> generate shield map around character
//shield map highlights terrain and enemy gunners within 90 degree cone emanating from center of gunner
// shield can be rotated/swiveled around with the mouse
	-> when player inputs confirmation, record orientation of shield
	-> end turn
IF player clicks on OVERWATCH
-> run overwtch procedure
	-> generate overwatch map around character

// overwatch map highlights terrain and enemy gunners within 45 degree cone emanating from center of gunner
// overwatch zone can be rotated/swiveled around with the mouse
